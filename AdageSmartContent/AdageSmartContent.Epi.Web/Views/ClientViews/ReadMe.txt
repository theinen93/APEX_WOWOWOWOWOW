This is the Client Views folder. 
Any overrides for views in the AdageViews folder should be added here, following the same folder structure.  
Views in this folder will be used instead of the view with the same name in the AdageViews folder.  

Any new client-specific views (views not part of the EpiKit) should be added to this folder.
